# scroll-to-recipe
A Chrome extension built to scroll you to the actual recipe on food blog/recipe sites, skipping all of the storytelling fluff.

## How it works
The extension searches web page headings for the word 'Ingredients'. If one is found, a bright pink button will appear in the top right corner of the page offering to scroll you to it. 

This works especially well on blog sites, where the pages tend to be long and include a lot of storytelling before revealing the actual recipe.
